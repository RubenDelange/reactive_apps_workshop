## First excercise

Implement the reducers in 'src/statemanagement/reducers'

There are 4 reducers to complete: 
- appliation.reducer.ts
- collapsable-sidebar.reducer.ts
- wines.reducer.ts
- authentication.reducer.ts (already implemented)

You will see that the tests are already implemented.
With the use of wallaby.js you will constantly get feedback which should make it easier for you!

**Remember**:
- Reducers should be immutable(!)
- Reducers are pure functions and have no dependencies
- Reducers always update a specific piece of the state
